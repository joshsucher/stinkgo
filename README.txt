STINKGO!

Stinkgo is a Raspberry Pi-based device that detects your proximity to ginkgo trees while you're walking down NYC sidewalks and warns you with a vibrating alert. 

Why? The ginkgo fruit smells awful.

Requirements: Raspberry Pi, php5, php5dev, sqlite3, wiringpi-php, php geohash class.

A web simulator exists at stinkgo.com.

A full tutorial exists at thingswemake.com/stinkgo/.
